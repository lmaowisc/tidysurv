This site presents materials for the short course **Tidy Survival Analysis: Applying R’s Tidyverse to Survival Data** to be taught at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) in Nashville, TN.

**This course** aims to equip participants with the skills to apply tidy principles to survival analysis, fostering a more organized and reproducible approach to data analysis in R.

In a tidyverse approach, we apply consistent data workflows to survival analysis tasks. This means using tibble data frames and `dplyr` for data preparation, keeping outputs tidy (one row per observation or estimate), and leveraging `ggplot2` for visualization. For example, one might create the survival outcome as a new column using `Surv(time, status)` within a `dplyr` pipeline, fit models and then use broom to `tidy()` model outputs into data frames, and produce publication-quality tables and plots with `gtsummary` and `ggplot2` or `ggsurvfit`. 
The goal is a reproducible workflow where raw data are transformed, analyzed, and visualized seamlessly.

**Target Audience**: Statisticians, data analysts, researchers, and students interested in survival analysis who are familiar with R and the Tidyverse.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  Understand the fundamentals of survival analysis, including key concepts such as censored data, survival functions, and hazard functions.
2.  Utilize R’s Tidyverse packages to manipulate, visualize, and analyze survival data.
3.  Fit and interpret survival models using the survival and survminer packages in conjunction with Tidyverse functions.
4.  Create clear and informative visualizations of survival data, including Kaplan-Meier curves and survival distributions.
5.  Communicate survival analysis results effectively using tidy principles.
